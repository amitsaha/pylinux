pylinux: Python interface to Linux System Information
=====================================================

pylinux_ is a Python interface to system information on Linux
systems. It uses simple text processing to read system files
and also wraps number of functionalities exposed by standard modules
such as `os`, `platform` and `sys` to expose a single easy to use Python
interface to such information.
